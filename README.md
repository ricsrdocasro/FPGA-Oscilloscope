## 🧠 Project Structure

The oscilloscope is composed of **three main VHDL modules**:

### 🔹 `top.vhd`
Integrates all submodules:
- Connects the ADC acquisition logic (`adc_teste`)
- Sends processed data to VGA renderer (`vga_teste`)
- Optionally outputs debug data to 7-segment displays

### 🔹 `adc_teste.vhd`
Simulates analog signal acquisition:
- Uses a simulated 12-bit ADC (`adcteste`)
- Converts sampled analog voltage into digital values
- Controls sampling frequency via a clock divider
- Displays current ADC value on HEX0–HEX2 (optional)

### 🔹 `vga_teste.vhd`
Draws waveforms on the VGA screen:
- Implements 640×480 @ 60Hz VGA timing
- Scales incoming 12-bit samples to vertical resolution
- Continuously scrolls waveform left to right
- Overlays a grid every 64px (horizontal) and 48px (vertical)
- Colors:
  - 🟩 Waveform: green
  - ⬛ Background: black
  - 🟥 Grid: dark gray

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Sampling (ADC)**
   - The FPGA samples analog signals using a simulated `adcteste` module (can be replaced by a real ADC module if desired).
   - Sampling clock is generated by dividing the 50MHz system clock to match ~1MHz rate.

2. **Buffering**
   - A circular buffer stores the last 640 samples.
   - Another buffer (`display_buffer`) shifts samples to simulate scrolling across the screen.

3. **VGA Rendering**
   - At 25MHz (half the system clock), pixels are drawn on screen.
   - The waveform is rendered by scaling the 12-bit sample to 480 vertical pixels.
   - Wave points are drawn with ±2 pixel thickness for visibility.
   - Gridlines are overlaid for signal analysis.

## 🔧 Getting Started

### Requirements
- [Intel Quartus Prime](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/overview.html)
- Intel DE10-Lite FPGA Board
- VGA Monitor and cable

### Compilation Steps
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `top.vhd` as the top-level entity in Quartus.
3. Assign appropriate FPGA pins (this doesn't need to be done if you use the Golden-Top file):
   - VGA (R/G/B, HS, VS)
   - 7-segment display (HEX0–HEX2)
4. Compile and program the FPGA.
5. Connect analog signal to CH0 of ADC input.
6. Observe real-time waveform on VGA screen.
